AddThis Flash Examples
======================
======================

This is the AddThis Flash example code set.  See http://www.addthis.com/help/flash-examples for a full description of this download.  


Overview
========

This archive includes several things:
  - source code to a simple wrapper over the AddThis Sharing Endpoints (http://www.addthis.com/help/sharing-api)
  - source code to a Flash-based sharing menu that uses this API wrapper
  - two sample "hello world" applications, one that uses the sharing apis, and one that uses the flash sharing menu
  - a sample video player that uses the demo in a more realistic scenario


What's Included
===============

The source tree should be relatively self-explanatory.  Key highlights:

  - Take a look at /dist/swf/demos.html to see the three different sample applications in action

  - All Sharing functionality is supported by the com.addthis.share.ShareAPI class, a thin wrapper over the AddThis Sharing Endpoints (http://www.addthis.com/help/sharing-api).  You can use this class directly in your own source, or use the provided SWF version of it.

  - The Flash sharing menu implementation is provided by com.addthis.menu.MenuAPI class, which implements a full menu on top of the ShareAPI class.  Like the ShareAPI, you can use it in source or by including the SWF directly.  If you use it in source, make sure to copy the com.addthis.share and com.addthis.menu packages in their entirety.

  - The /dist/swf folder contains pre-built SWFs that you can use, for both APIs as well as the demos

  - The /flas folder contains the FLA files for the two Hello World examples, while the video player demo is source only
